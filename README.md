# Linkedin Learning Warehouse 
LinkedIn API is a RESTful web service that allows developers to access LinkedInâ€™s professional network data, such as user profiles, connections, and content. This API is commonly used for integrating LinkedIn functionality into external applications, enabling features like social sharing, user authentication, and access to LinkedIn learning progress and assets. 
This a **.NET 8 console application** that consumes the LinkedIn API to track employee training progress. This application handles LinkedIn API queries and processes responses. The program was built to collect training data (Learning Activity Reports and Learning Assets Reports) from employees and store it in a newly created database.
